Programming is as much a difference from coding as writing is from typing - adapted from Leslie Lamport

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have come to view quality code as a spectacle worthy to be called art. The readability of my own code (including comments and variable naming etc.) represent my capability of explaining as well as understanding of the respective code.

Programming in general has become one of my greatest passions over the past few years. My specific interests at the moment include a learning expidition into the field of machine learning as well as teaching other people the fundamentals of programming where I specifically place emphasis on the usecases, definitons, and importance of functions.

I am currently a final year undergraduate industrial engineering student at Stellenbosch University, where I have the opportunity to design and implement a minimal viable product (MVP) for a computer vision enriched search engine. This search engine also entails a novel approach to scene segmentation and is applied to sport analysis for the improvement thereof.

More projects and ideas are to come to this repositry!
